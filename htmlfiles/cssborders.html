    <p style="border: double; background-color: coral; border-top-color: blue; border-bottom-color:blue ; border-right-color: blue; border-left-color: blue;">Israel's history dates back to biblical times, with the Hebrew patriarchs and the establishment of a united monarchy under Kings Saul, David, and Solomon. The kingdom later split, and both Israel and Judah fell to foreign empires, leading to the Babylonian exile in 586 BCE. The Jews returned under Persian rule and rebuilt the Second Temple, but Roman rule led to its destruction in 70 CE and Jewish dispersal. Muslim Arabs conquered the region in 636 CE, followed by Crusader, Mamluk, and Ottoman rule. The Zionist movement emerged in the late 19th century, advocating for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. After World War I, Britain controlled the region, and tensions grew between Jews and Arabs. In 1948, Israel declared independence, sparking the first Arab-Israeli war. Israel fought multiple wars, including the Six-Day War (1967) and Yom Kippur War (1973), shaping its modern borders. Peace efforts, such as the Egypt-Israel Treaty (1979) and Oslo Accords (1993), sought conflict resolution. Today, Israel remains a key player in Middle Eastern politics, balancing security, diplomacy, and regional tensions.</p>
